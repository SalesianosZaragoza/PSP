        "Historically, the programming knowledge required to set up multithreading was beyond the scope of this course, as it involved a good understanding of Python's Global Interpreter Lock (the GIL prevents multiple threads from running the same Python code at once). Also, you had to set up special classes that behave like Producers to divvy up the work, Consumers (aka \"workers\") to perform the work, and a Queue to hold tasks and provide communcations. And that was just the beginning.\n",
